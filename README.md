DbScriptDeploy
==============

This is a simple database deployment application that allows you to deploy changes to a database (currently SQL Server only) and compare instances of the same database.

NOTE: This project is still in a prootype phase: it works but the UI is a joke, there are no tests, and it's basically a mess.  Don't use it.
